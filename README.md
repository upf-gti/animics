[**Animics**](https://animics.gti.upf.edu) is a web-based tool for generating 3D character animations, with a strong focus on sign language and embodied communication. It provides two separate workflows ‚Äî **Script Mode** and **Keyframe Mode** ‚Äî for building animations either procedurally or from video data.

> üöÄ This project is part of **T√†ndem**, an open suite of tools for expressive, accessible 3D animation.

## ‚ú® Features

### üé¨ Script Mode: Procedural Sign Language Animation based on phonetic representations

Build animations by combining predefined "clips" generated procedurally from and extended **Behavior Markup Language (BML)** and adapted **Signing Gesture Mark-up Language (SiGML)** instructions. These clips cover both **Manual Features (MF)** and **Non-Manual Features (NMF)** ‚Äî such as hand gestures, facial expressions, mouthing, gaze, and body posture ‚Äî synthesized in real-time.

- Based on **SiGML** and **BML**.
- Animation sequences are constructed through configurable parameters for each action or instruction.
- Focused on natural, linguistically grounded animation for sign language.

#### üß† Public Linguistic Database

- **1,722 glosses** in **NGT** (Sign Language of the Netherlands).
- **6,484 phrases** in **LSF-CH** (Swiss version of the French Sign Language).
- All entries are encoded in **SiGML** and **BML** (as a JSON), and can be used within **Script Mode**.
- Users can create **their own entries** or integrate **public datasets** to expand the database.

> üìå *Script Mode and Keyframe Mode are separate workflows and cannot be combined.*

### üìπ Keyframe Mode: Pose Extraction from Video

Generate animations from human motion captured in video.

- Record yourself with the **webcam** or upload one or multiple video files.
- Pose and facial data is extracted using **MediaPipe**:
  - **Body landmarks**
  - **Facial Action Units**
- Data is mapped internally to:
  - **Skeleton joint rotations**
  - **Morph target weights** for facial expression control.
- Includes **Inverse Kinematics (IK)** for precise adjustments. This feature can be toggled on or off.
- Includes **window-based propagation**, which allows edits made in one frame to automatically influence neighboring frames within a configurable time window. This feature can be toggled on or off.

> üìå *Keyframe Mode and Script Mode are mutually exclusive per animation.*

### üíæ Save, Load & Export

- Users can **register and log in** to save their animations (both modes) to the server and **retrieve them later** for further editing.
- Animations can also be created and exported **without logging in**.
- Supported export formats:

| Mode            | Formats                                 |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Script Mode     | `BML (JSON)`, `GLB`                      |
| Keyframe Mode   | `BVH`, `BVHE` (extended BVH with facial), `GLB` |
| Keyframe Extras | Raw `MediaPipe` data, original `video`   |

---

### üöÄ **Import & Visualize Animations**

- **Import animation files**: Users can import previously saved animation files in both **Script Mode** and **Keyframe Mode** to continue editing or refine them.
- **Visualize animations in Performs**: Generated animations from both modes can be directly visualized in [Performs](https://github.com/upf-gti/performs), the companion application of the T√†ndem suite to play the animations in different avatars, customize the scene and be integrated in other applications.

### üß© Modular & Friendly UI

- Minimalist, intuitive interface
- Switch easily between Script and Keyframe modes
- Real-time animation preview and editing
